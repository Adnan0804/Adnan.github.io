				<h2>CS2 professional players are players that compete at the absolute pinnacle of esports. Those who win a major as a CS pro, their names are forever etched into the history books and they are immortalized in the eyes of all esports fans as one of the best of all time. Being a professional CS2 player is a privilage by itself, but to be remembered as the best is an accolade that an extremely small number of players have accomplished over the years. And even then, their legacies are stiil questioned as many believe that the "best" title should be held to a much higher standard. Therefore, leaving a legacy in this game is everything for so many professional CS players.</h2></p>
